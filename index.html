  <p> It is a system that begins to consider potential environmental and social impacts by eliminating the use of
    synthetic inputs, such as<br> synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, veterinary drugs, genetically modified seeds and
    breeds, preservatives, additives and irradiation. </p>
  <h3>Importance of Organic Agriculture</h3>
  <p><em>Maintain and improve fertility, soil structure and biodiversity, and reduce erosion.</em><br> Reduce the risks
    of human, animal, and environmental exposure to toxic materials. Fine-tune farming practices to meet local
    production conditions and satisfy local markets.</p><br>
  <h4>Types of organic farming</h4>
  <p>Organic farming is divided into two types, namely: Integrated organic farming. Pure organic farming.</p>

  <h5>Categories of organic agriculture</h5>
  <p>
  <ol>The Principles of Organic Agriculture are Health, Ecology , Fairness and Care.

  <p>AI systems are helping to improve the overall harvest quality and accuracy – known as precision agriculture.<br> AI
    technology helps in detecting disease in plants, pests and poor nutrition of farms.</p>
  <h2>Artificial important</h2>
  <p>Artificial intelligence forms the basis for all computer learning and is the future of all complex decision
    making.<br> As an example, most humans can figure out how to not lose at tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses), even
    though there are 255,168 unique moves, of which 46,080 end in a draw.<br></p>
  <h3>Types of artificial</h3>
  <p>
  <ol>Types of Artificial Intelligence:
    <li> Weak AI or Narrow AI: Narrow AI is a type of AI which is able to perform a dedicated task with intelligence. ..
    </li>.
    <li>General AI: General AI is a type of intelligence which could perform any intellectual task with efficiency like
      a human. </li>...
    Super AI:

    <h4>Impact of AI on agriculture</h4>
    <p>AI helps Improve Harvest Quality

      AI systems are helping improve the harvest quality and accuracy, which is known as precision agriculture. AI
      technology assist's in detecting the diseases in plants, pests, poor plant nutrition, etc.</p>
